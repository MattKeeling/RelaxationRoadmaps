# RelaxationRoadmaps
A set of code for the two forms of model (with and without waning) used in the paper "Comparison of the 2021 COVID-19 ’Roadmap’ Projections against Public Health Data"
The directory RoadMaps1to4 contains the code and data files to simulate the SARS-COV-2 outbreak in England, without waning of immunity or the booster program. The default code generates plots comparible to Roadmap 4b; other Roadmaps can be generated by changing the vaccine and precautionary behaviour assumptions.
The directory RoadMaps1to4 contains the code and data files to simulate Roadmap 5. The default code assumes repeated waning of immunity after boosting and a single set of assumptions for the speed of waning immunity.
